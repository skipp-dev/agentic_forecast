# System Forecasting Report
**Generated:** 20251205_232123

## Executive Summary
The latest backtest run processed 1972 symbols, training models for all of them with an average MAPE of 3.89% and a median MAPE of 2.68%. No anomalies were detected, and the guardrails were inactive, indicating no system checks were performed. Importantly, there were no risk events, confirming that the system is functioning as expected without any business-rule violations. The platform is safe to proceed with further analyses and operations.

## Performance Overview
*(Audience: quants)*
The backtest run evaluated 1972 models, all of which were trained successfully. 
- **Average MAPE**: 3.89% 
- **Median MAPE**: 2.68% 
- **Best Performing Symbol**: ANNX_daily 
- **Worst Performing Symbol**: TDIC_daily 

The leaderboard shows that all models performed at the baseline level, with no promotions this run.

## Operational Status
*(Audience: ops)*
The guardrails were inactive during this run, resulting in no checks being performed. 
- **Total Checks**: 0 
- **Passed Checks**: 0 
- **Warnings**: 0 
- **Critical Issues**: None 

This indicates that the system is stable, but it is essential to ensure guardrails are activated for future runs to maintain oversight.

## Risk Assessment
*(Audience: management)*
There were no risk events during this run, indicating that all business rules were adhered to without any violations. 
- **Risk Events**: None 

The absence of risk events confirms that the platform is operating within acceptable parameters.

## Key Risks
- Guardrails were inactive, which may lead to unmonitored system performance in future runs.
- No HPO trials were run, limiting optimization opportunities.

## Key Opportunities
- Activate guardrails for future runs to ensure system checks and balances are in place.
- Consider running HPO trials to explore potential improvements in model performance.

## Actions for Quants
- Review the performance of the worst-performing symbols (TDIC_daily) and investigate potential improvements.

## Actions for Ops
- Activate guardrails for the next run to ensure system integrity and monitoring.
