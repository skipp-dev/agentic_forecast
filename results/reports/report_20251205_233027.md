## Risk Assessment
*(Audience: management)*
### Risk Overview
- **Risk Events**: None detected, indicating that the risk management framework is functioning correctly.
- **Guardrail Status**: Inactive, with no checks performed. This suggests that the system is currently not enforcing any risk limits.

## Key Risks
- Inactive guardrails could lead to unmonitored risk exposure in future runs.
- Dependence on BaselineLinear models without exploring challengers may limit performance improvements.

## Key Opportunities
- Explore optimization trials for models to improve performance metrics.
- Consider activating guardrails to ensure risk management is in place.

## Actions for Quants
- Investigate the performance of BaselineLinear models and consider testing challenger models.

## Actions for Ops
- Review the guardrail configuration to ensure they are active for future runs.
