  "global_summary": "The overall health of the forecasting system appears stable, with metrics showing reasonable ranges and variability. However, the directional accuracy is alarmingly low, with a mean of only 0.013, indicating that the model struggles to predict the correct direction of price movements. The MAE and RMSE values suggest that while the absolute errors are manageable on average, there are instances of significantly larger errors, as indicated by the maximum values. The lack of variability in feature importance suggests that the model may not be leveraging relevant features effectively, which could be a concern for future predictions.",
  "metric_explanations": {
    "mae": "The mean absolute error (MAE) is 2.18, indicating that on average, the model's predictions deviate from actual values by this amount. However, the maximum MAE of 58.658 suggests that there are outliers or specific instances where the model performs poorly.",
    "mape": "The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is 0.039, which is relatively low, but the maximum value of 0.446 indicates that there are cases where the model's predictions are significantly off, potentially skewing the average.",
    "smape": "The symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE) has a mean of 0.038, closely aligning with MAPE, which suggests consistent performance across predictions. However, the maximum value of 0.358 indicates that some predictions are highly inaccurate.",
    "mase": "Not available.",
    "swase": "The mean SWASE is 0.041, indicating a slight bias in predictions, but the maximum value of 0.479 suggests that in certain instances, the model may be significantly underestimating or overestimating outcomes.",
    "directional_accuracy": "The directional accuracy is extremely low, with a mean of 0.013, indicating that the model is correct in predicting the direction of price movement only 1.3% of the time on average. This is a critical issue that needs addressing."
