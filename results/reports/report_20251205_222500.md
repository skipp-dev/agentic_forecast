# System Forecasting Report
**Generated:** 20251205_222500

## Executive Summary
The latest backtest run processed 1972 symbols, with an average MAPE of approximately 3.89% and a median MAPE of 2.68%. No anomalies were detected during this run, and all guardrails were inactive, indicating no potential system issues. Importantly, there were no risk events, confirming that the system is functioning as expected without any portfolio rejections. The models trained during this run have not resulted in any promotions, as all models evaluated were BaselineLinear.
