# System Forecasting Report
**Generated:** 20251205_174623

## Executive Summary
The latest daily run processed 1 symbol with a total of 1972 models trained, achieving an average MAPE of 3.89% and a median MAPE of 2.68%. No anomalies were detected, and the guardrails are currently inactive with no checks performed. Importantly, there were no risk events reported, indicating that the system is functioning as expected and is safe to proceed. However, there were no model promotions this run, highlighting an opportunity for further optimization.

## Performance Overview
*(Audience: quants)*
- **Total Symbols Processed**: 1
- **Models Trained**: 1972
- **Average MAPE**: 3.89%
- **Median MAPE**: 2.68%
- **Best Performing Symbol**: ANNX_daily
- **Worst Performing Symbol**: TDIC_daily

The model comparison shows that the BaselineLinear model continues to dominate, with 986 baseline wins against 0 for challengers.

## Operational Insights
*(Audience: ops)*
- **Guardrail Status**: Inactive (0 checks performed)
- **Risk Events**: None
- **System Health**: Stable with no errors encountered during execution.

The system is currently safe to proceed, but the inactive guardrails suggest a need for review to ensure proper monitoring and risk management.

## Research Insights
*(Audience: management)*
- **Key Findings**: Strong directional accuracy (100%) observed in several symbols including AAL_daily and AAPL_daily.
- **Market Implications**: N/A

The research indicates that the models are performing well in terms of directional accuracy, which is a positive sign for forecasting reliability.

## Key Risks
- Inactive guardrails may lead to unmonitored risks in future runs.
- No model promotions indicate a potential stagnation in performance improvements.

## Key Opportunities
- Explore optimization strategies to enhance model performance and potentially increase promotions.
- Consider reactivating guardrails to ensure ongoing risk management.

## Actions for Quants
- Investigate the lack of promotions and assess the performance of existing models to identify areas for improvement.
