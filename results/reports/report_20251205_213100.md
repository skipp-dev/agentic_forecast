# System Forecasting Report
**Generated:** 20251205_213100

## Executive Summary
The latest backtest run processed 1972 symbols with an average MAPE of 3.89% and a median MAPE of 2.68%. No anomalies were detected, and the guardrails are currently inactive, indicating no system issues. Importantly, there were no risk events during this run, meaning all portfolios were executed as expected. The system is safe to proceed with further analyses and operations.

## Performance Overview
*(Audience: quants)*
- **Total Symbols Processed**: 1972
- **Models Trained**: 1972
- **Average MAPE**: 3.89%
- **Median MAPE**: 2.68%
- **Best Performing Symbol**: ANNX_daily
- **Worst Performing Symbol**: TDIC_daily

The performance metrics indicate that the models are performing well, with a significant number of baseline wins (986) compared to challenger wins (0). This suggests that the BaselineLinear model is currently the most effective.

## Guardrail and Risk Assessment
*(Audience: ops)*
- **Guardrail Status**: Inactive
- **Total Checks**: 0
- **Passed Checks**: 0
- **Warnings**: 0
- **Critical Issues**: None

The guardrails were inactive during this run, which means there were no checks performed. This is not indicative of a failure but rather a configuration choice. The system can proceed without any immediate concerns.

## Risk and Opportunity Insights
*(Audience: management)*
