# System Forecasting Report
**Generated:** 20251204_223331

## Executive Summary
The latest run of the forecasting platform processed 1972 symbols and trained 1972 models, achieving an average MAPE of 3.89%. No anomalies were detected, and the guardrails are currently inactive, indicating no checks were performed. Importantly, there were no risk events, confirming that the system is functioning as expected without any portfolio rejections. Overall, the system is safe to proceed with further operations.

## Model Performance Overview
*(Audience: quants)*
- **Total Models Trained:** 1972
- **Average MAPE:** 3.89%
- **Median MAPE:** 2.68%
- **Best Performing Symbol:** ANNX_daily
- **Worst Performing Symbol:** TDIC_daily

The model comparison shows that all models are currently classified under the BaselineLinear family, with no promotions to more advanced models.

## Guardrail and Risk Assessment
*(Audience: ops)*
- **Guardrail Status:** Inactive (no checks performed)
- **Risk Events:** None detected

The system's guardrails did not trigger any checks during this run, indicating a potential configuration issue. However, this also means that the system is not currently enforcing any risk management protocols.

## Research Insights
*(Audience: management)*
- **Key Findings:** Detected 1 anomalous pattern requiring attention.
- **Market Implications:** Analysis completed with SHAP insights and anomaly detection.

The research indicates strong directional accuracy across several symbols, suggesting that the models are performing well in predicting market movements.

## Key Risks
- Guardrails are inactive, which may expose the system to unforeseen risks.
- Anomalous patterns detected that require further investigation.

## Key Opportunities
- Potential to optimize models further as no HPO trials were run this time.
- Opportunity to enhance guardrail configurations to ensure risk management.

## Actions for Quants
- Investigate the anomalous patterns detected and assess their impact on model performance.
- Consider running HPO trials to explore potential improvements in model accuracy.

## Actions for Ops
- Review and activate guardrail configurations to ensure risk management protocols are in place.
- Monitor the system for any unexpected behavior due to inactive guardrails.
