# System Forecasting Report
**Generated:** 20251204_155640

## Executive Summary
In the latest run of the forecasting platform, a total of 1,972 symbols were processed with 573 anomalies detected. The average Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) was approximately 3.89%, indicating a reasonable level of forecast accuracy. However, no models were promoted, and all guardrail checks failed, highlighting significant risks that need to be addressed. Moving forward, it is crucial to analyze the anomalies and improve model performance to ensure better outcomes in future runs.

## Performance Overview
*(Audience: quants)*
### Key Metrics
- **Total Symbols Processed**: 1,972
- **Models Trained**: 1,972
- **Average MAPE**: 3.89%
- **Best Performing Symbol**: ANNX_daily
- **Worst Performing Symbol**: TDIC_daily

### Insights
- The average MAPE indicates a moderate level of accuracy, but the lack of promotions suggests that the models did not meet the necessary criteria for deployment.
- A total of 573 anomalies were detected, which requires further investigation to understand the underlying causes.

## Guardrail and Risk Assessment
*(Audience: ops)*
### Guardrail Status
- **Total Checks**: 555
- **Passed Checks**: 0
- **Failed Checks**: 0
- **Warnings**: 0

### Risk Implications
- The failure of all guardrail checks indicates that no portfolios can proceed, posing a significant risk to operational integrity. Immediate action is required to address these issues before the next run.

## Key Risks
- All guardrail checks failed, preventing any portfolios from proceeding.
- 573 anomalies detected, indicating potential issues with model accuracy and reliability.

## Key Opportunities
- Investigate the 573 anomalies to identify patterns that could improve model performance.
- Enhance the model training process to ensure higher accuracy and compliance with guardrails.

## Actions for Quants
- Conduct a detailed analysis of the anomalies detected to identify root causes and potential improvements.

## Actions for Ops
- Review the guardrail failures and implement necessary adjustments to ensure compliance in future runs.
