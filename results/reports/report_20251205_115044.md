# System Forecasting Report
**Generated:** 20251205_115044

## Executive Summary
The latest daily run processed 3 symbols with a total of 1972 models trained. The average MAPE was 3.89%, indicating good model performance, with no anomalies detected. All guardrails were inactive, and there were no risk events, confirming that the system is safe to proceed. However, the lack of active guardrails raises concerns about potential oversight in monitoring model performance.

## Performance Overview
*(Audience: quants)*
- **Total Models Evaluated**: 1972
- **Average MAPE**: 3.89%
- **Median MAPE**: 2.68%
- **Best Performing Symbol**: ANNX_daily
- **Worst Performing Symbol**: TDIC_daily

The model leaderboard shows that all symbols are currently using the BaselineLinear model, which has dominated the performance metrics.

## Guardrail and Risk Assessment
*(Audience: ops)*
- **Guardrail Status**: Inactive
- **Total Checks**: 0
- **Passed Checks**: 0
- **Warnings**: 0
- **Critical Issues**: None

The absence of active guardrails may lead to unmonitored performance issues. It is essential to review the configuration to ensure guardrails are appropriately set up.

## Research Insights
*(Audience: management)*
- **Key Findings**: Strong directional accuracy (100%) for several symbols including AAL and AAPL.
- **Market Implications**: No significant market implications noted at this time.

The research indicates that the current models are performing well, but continuous monitoring is recommended to maintain performance.

## Key Risks
- Inactive guardrails may lead to unmonitored model performance issues.
- No risk events reported, but the lack of guardrails raises concerns.

## Key Opportunities
- Potential to optimize models further as no HPO trials were run.
- Review and activate guardrails to enhance monitoring and risk management.

## Actions for Quants
- Investigate the performance of BaselineLinear against potential challengers to improve model selection.

## Actions for Ops
- Review and activate guardrails to ensure proper monitoring of model performance.
