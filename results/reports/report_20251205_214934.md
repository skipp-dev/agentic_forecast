# System Forecasting Report
**Generated:** 20251205_214934

## Executive Summary
The latest backtest run processed 1972 symbols, with an average MAPE of approximately 3.89% and a median MAPE of about 2.68%. No anomalies were detected during this run, and all guardrails were inactive, indicating no potential system issues. Importantly, there were no risk events reported, confirming that the system is functioning as expected without any blocked trades. The BaselineLinear model continues to dominate the leaderboard with 986 wins against challengers.

## Performance Overview
*(Audience: quants)*
- Total models trained: 1972
- Average MAPE: 3.89%
- Median MAPE: 2.68%
- Best performing symbol: ANNX_daily
- Worst performing symbol: TDIC_daily

The performance metrics indicate a strong overall model performance, with the BaselineLinear model consistently outperforming challengers.

## Operational Insights
*(Audience: ops)*
- Guardrails status: Inactive
- Total checks: 0 (no checks performed)
- No risk events reported

The operational health of the system is stable, with no guardrail issues or risk events affecting the execution of trades.

## Strategic Recommendations
*(Audience: management)*
- The current model performance is satisfactory, but continuous monitoring is recommended to ensure that future runs maintain or improve upon these metrics.
- Consider exploring new data sources to enhance model accuracy.

## Key Opportunities
- Explore new data sources to improve model performance.
- Monitor the performance of the BaselineLinear model for potential enhancements.

## Actions for Quants
- Investigate the performance of the worst performing symbols (e.g., TDIC_daily) to identify potential improvements.

## Actions for Ops
- Ensure that guardrails are configured correctly for future runs to maintain system integrity.
