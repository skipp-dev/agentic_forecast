# System Forecasting Report
**Generated:** 20251205_194233

## Executive Summary
The latest backtest run processed 2 symbols and trained a total of 1972 models, achieving an average MAPE of approximately 3.89%. No anomalies were detected, and the guardrails were inactive with no checks performed. Importantly, there were no risk events, indicating that the system is functioning as expected and is safe to proceed. The model comparison shows that the BaselineLinear model continues to dominate the leaderboard with 986 baseline wins and no challenger wins.

## Model Performance Overview
*(Audience: quants)*
- **Total Models Trained**: 1972
- **Average MAPE**: 3.89%
- **Median MAPE**: 2.68%
- **Best Performing Symbol**: ANNX_daily
- **Worst Performing Symbol**: TDIC_daily

The models trained show consistent performance, with the BaselineLinear model leading across all symbols. Further analysis on the worst performing symbols may provide insights for future improvements.

## Operational Health and Guardrails
*(Audience: ops)*
- **Guardrail Status**: Inactive
- **Total Checks**: 0
- **Passed Checks**: 0
- **Warnings**: 0
- **Critical Issues**: None

The guardrails were inactive during this run, indicating no potential system or configuration issues. However, it is essential to ensure that guardrails are appropriately configured for future runs to maintain system integrity.

## Risk Assessment
*(Audience: management)*
- **Risk Events**: None
- **Interpretation**: The system is functioning correctly without any risk events, indicating that all business rules are being adhered to.

This reflects positively on the risk management framework in place, ensuring that no over-risk portfolios were executed.

## Key Risks
- Guardrails were inactive, which could lead to unmonitored system performance in future runs.
- No HPO trials were run, limiting optimization opportunities.

## Key Opportunities
- Explore optimization strategies for the top-performing models to enhance performance further.
- Reassess guardrail configurations to ensure they are active in future runs.

## Actions for Quants
- Investigate the performance of the worst performing symbols (e.g., TDIC_daily) to identify potential improvements.

## Actions for Ops
- Review and configure guardrails to ensure they are active for the next run.
