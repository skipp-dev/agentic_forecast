# System Forecasting Report
**Generated:** 20251205_133315

## Executive Summary
The latest run of the forecasting platform processed 1 symbol and trained 1972 models, achieving an average MAPE of 3.89% and a median MAPE of 2.68%. No anomalies were detected, and all guardrails were inactive with no checks performed. Importantly, there were no risk events, indicating that the system is functioning as expected and is safe to proceed. However, the lack of guardrail checks raises potential concerns about system configuration that should be addressed.

## Performance Overview
*(Audience: quants)*
- Total symbols processed: 1
- Models trained: 1972
- Average MAPE: 3.89%
- Median MAPE: 2.68%
- Best performing symbol: ANNX_daily
- Worst performing symbol: TDIC_daily

The model comparison shows that the BaselineLinear model continues to dominate the leaderboard with 986 baseline wins and no challenger wins.

## Operational Insights
*(Audience: ops)*
- Guardrail status: Inactive
- Total checks: 0 (no checks performed)
- Passed checks: 0
- Warnings: 0
- Critical issues: None

The system is currently configured to not perform guardrail checks, which may lead to potential risks in future runs. It is essential to review this configuration.

## Risk Assessment
*(Audience: management)*
- No risk events were recorded during this run, indicating that the system is operating within expected parameters.
- The absence of guardrail checks could pose a risk if future data quality issues arise.

## Key Risks
- Inactive guardrails may lead to undetected issues in future runs.
- No HPO trials were run, limiting optimization opportunities.

## Key Opportunities
- Review and activate guardrails to enhance system reliability.
- Consider increasing HPO trials for models with high MAPE.

## Actions for Quants
- Investigate the performance of the BaselineLinear model and explore potential improvements for the worst-performing symbols.

## Actions for Ops
- Review the configuration of guardrails to ensure they are active for future runs.
