# System Forecasting Report
**Generated:** 20251205_195238

## Executive Summary
The latest backtest run processed 2 symbols and trained 1972 models, achieving an average MAPE of approximately 3.89% and a median MAPE of about 2.68%. No anomalies were detected, and the guardrails were inactive, indicating no system checks were performed. Importantly, there were no risk events, confirming that the system is functioning as expected without any portfolio rejections. The system is safe to proceed with further evaluations and optimizations.
