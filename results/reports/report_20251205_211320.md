# System Forecasting Report
**Generated:** 20251205_211320

## Executive Summary
The latest backtest run processed 1972 symbols, with an average MAPE of 3.89% and a median MAPE of 2.68%. No anomalies were detected, and all guardrails were inactive, indicating no potential system issues. Importantly, there were no risk events, suggesting that the system is functioning as expected without any blocked trades. The BaselineLinear model continues to dominate the leaderboard with 986 wins against challengers. Overall, the system is safe to proceed.

## Performance Overview
*(Audience: quants)*
### Performance Metrics
- **Total Symbols Processed**: 1972
- **Models Trained**: 1972
- **Average MAPE**: 3.89%
- **Median MAPE**: 2.68%
- **Best Performing Symbol**: ANNX_daily

### Model Comparison
- The BaselineLinear model has achieved 986 wins, while no challengers have succeeded. This indicates a strong performance baseline.

## Operational Health
*(Audience: ops)*
### Guardrail Status
- **Total Checks**: 0
- **Passed Checks**: 0
- **Warnings**: 0
- **Critical Issues**: None

### System Health
- The system is stable with no errors encountered during the run. All guardrails are inactive, which means there are no current configurations that could lead to system issues.

## Risk Assessment
*(Audience: management)*
### Risk Events
- **Risk Events**: None detected, indicating that the system is operating within expected parameters without any blocked trades.

### Interpretation
- The absence of risk events suggests that the system is functioning effectively, with no portfolios being blocked due to risk limits.

## Key Opportunities
- Explore potential optimizations for the models that did not perform as well as BaselineLinear.
- Consider re-evaluating the inactive guardrails to ensure they align with operational goals.

## Actions for Quants
- Investigate the performance of models that consistently underperform compared to BaselineLinear.

## Actions for Ops
- Review the configuration of guardrails to ensure they are set to active for future runs.
