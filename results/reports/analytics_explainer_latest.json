  "global_summary": "The overall health of the forecasting system appears stable with low variability in metrics. The mean MAE of 2.18 and MAPE of 0.039 indicate reasonable accuracy, though the maximum values suggest potential outliers. Directional accuracy is notably low with a mean of 0.013, indicating frequent mispredictions in direction. The absence of critical calculation errors and reasonable ranges in metrics suggest no immediate data quality issues. However, the lack of feature importance in both overall and shock regimes raises concerns about model interpretability and effectiveness.",
  "metric_explanations": {
    "mae": "The MAE shows a mean error of 2.18, which is acceptable, but the maximum of 58.658 indicates significant outliers that could skew performance assessments.",
    "mape": "The MAPE mean of 0.039 suggests good performance overall, but the maximum of 0.446 indicates that some predictions are significantly off, warranting further investigation.",
    "smape": "SMAPE is consistent with MAPE, having a mean of 0.038 and a maximum of 0.358, indicating that while most predictions are close, there are instances of substantial error.",
    "swase": "The SWASE mean of 0.041 and maximum of 0.479 suggest that while errors are generally low, there may be bias or asymmetric errors present, particularly in shock regimes.",
    "directional_accuracy": "The directional accuracy mean of 0.013 indicates that the model is rarely correct in predicting the direction of changes, which is a significant concern for deployment."
