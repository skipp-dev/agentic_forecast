## Executive Summary
The latest backtest run processed 1972 symbols with an average MAPE of 3.89% and a median MAPE of 2.68%. No anomalies were detected, and the guardrails were inactive, indicating no system issues. Importantly, there were no risk events, confirming that the system is safe to proceed without any portfolio rejections. The model performance shows that BaselineLinear remains the leading model across all evaluated symbols.

## Performance Overview
*(Audience: quants)*
- Total models trained: 1972
- Average MAPE: 3.89%
- Median MAPE: 2.68%
- Best performing symbol: ANNX_daily
- Worst performing symbol: TDIC_daily

The model comparison indicates that BaselineLinear is the dominant model, winning 986 times against challengers.

## Operational Insights
*(Audience: ops)*
- Guardrails status: Inactive (0 total checks)
- No errors encountered during the run.
- System health is stable with no performance issues reported.

The absence of guardrail checks suggests that the system is not currently monitoring for potential issues, which may need to be addressed in future runs.

## Risk Assessment
*(Audience: management)*
- No risk events were recorded during this run, indicating that all portfolios were within acceptable limits.
- The system is deemed safe to proceed with no immediate concerns.

## Key Risks
- Guardrails are currently inactive, which may lead to undetected issues in future runs.
- No HPO trials were run, limiting optimization opportunities.

## Key Opportunities
- Consider activating guardrails to enhance system monitoring and safety.
- Explore HPO trials for models to improve performance metrics.

## Actions for Quants
- Investigate the performance of BaselineLinear to understand its dominance and explore potential enhancements.

## Actions for Ops
