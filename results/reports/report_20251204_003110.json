  "executive_summary": "The latest run of the forecasting platform processed 576 symbols with a focus on optimizing three key stocks: AMZN, AAPL, and MSFT. Despite the high volume of symbols, the performance metrics indicate no significant improvements, with an average performance of 0 and no top performers identified. Anomalies were detected in the data, highlighting areas that require further investigation. The health checks passed without critical issues, allowing us to proceed with the next steps.",
