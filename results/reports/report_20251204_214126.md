# System Forecasting Report
**Generated:** 20251204_214126

## Executive Summary
The latest run of the forecasting platform processed 576 symbols with an average MAPE of 3.89% and a median MAPE of 2.68%. All guardrails failed, indicating potential configuration issues, while no risk events were triggered, suggesting that business rules are functioning as intended. The system is currently safe to proceed, but immediate attention is required to address the guardrail failures. Optimization efforts were completed for AAPL, MSFT, and NVDA, but no improvements were noted.

## Performance Overview
*(Audience: mixed)*
- **Total Symbols Processed:** 576
- **Models Trained:** 573
- **Average MAPE:** 3.89%
- **Median MAPE:** 2.68%
- **Anomalies Detected:** 0
- **Models Promoted:** 0

The performance metrics indicate a stable run, but the absence of promotions suggests that existing models are not being outperformed.

## Guardrail and Risk Assessment
*(Audience: mixed)*
- **Guardrail Status:** All 555 checks failed, indicating potential configuration issues.
- **Risk Events:** None detected, confirming that business rules are functioning correctly.

This situation requires immediate investigation to ensure guardrails are properly configured to prevent future failures.

## Optimization Insights
*(Audience: quants)*
- **Optimized Symbols:** AAPL, MSFT, NVDA
- **Best Improvements:** No improvements noted for these symbols despite optimizations.

Further analysis is needed to understand why optimizations did not yield better performance.

## Operational Notes
*(Audience: ops)*
- **System Health:** The system is stable with no crashes reported.
- **Data Quality:** 573 anomalies detected, requiring attention.
- **Maintenance Needs:** Review guardrail configurations to address the failures.

## Key Risks
- All guardrails failed, indicating potential configuration issues.
- Anomalies detected may affect future model performance.

## Key Opportunities
- Investigate optimization strategies for AAPL, MSFT, and NVDA to enhance model performance.
- Address guardrail failures to improve system reliability.

## Actions for Quants
- Conduct a detailed analysis of the guardrail failures and adjust configurations accordingly.
- Re-evaluate optimization strategies for AAPL, MSFT, and NVDA to identify potential improvements.

## Actions for Ops
- Review and rectify guardrail configurations to ensure proper functioning.
- Monitor the system for any further anomalies and address them promptly.
