# System Forecasting Report
**Generated:** 20251205_191551

## Executive Summary
The latest backtest run processed 2 symbols, with a total of 1972 models trained. The average MAPE achieved was approximately 3.89%, and the median MAPE was around 2.68%. No anomalies were detected during this run, and all guardrails were inactive, indicating no potential system issues. Importantly, there were no risk events, confirming that the system is safe to proceed without any blocked trades or portfolio rejections.

## Model Performance Overview
*(Audience: quants)*
- **Total Models Evaluated**: 1972
- **Average MAPE**: 3.89%
- **Median MAPE**: 2.68%
- **Best Performing Symbol**: ANNX_daily
- **Worst Performing Symbol**: TDIC_daily

The model comparison indicates that BaselineLinear is the leading model across all symbols, with 986 baseline wins and no challenger wins.

## Operational Health and Guardrails
*(Audience: ops)*
- **Guardrail Status**: Inactive
- **Total Checks**: 0
- **Passed Checks**: 0
- **Warnings**: 0
- **Critical Issues**: None

The guardrail checks were inactive during this run, indicating no potential system issues. The system is functioning as expected without any critical alerts.

## Risk Assessment
*(Audience: management)*
- **Risk Events**: None detected
- **Guardrail Integrity**: All checks inactive, no issues reported

The absence of risk events indicates that the system's risk management protocols are functioning correctly, and there were no portfolio rejections or other risk-related incidents.

## Key Opportunities
