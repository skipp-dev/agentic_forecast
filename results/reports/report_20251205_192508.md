# System Forecasting Report
**Generated:** 20251205_192508

## Executive Summary
The latest backtest run processed 1972 symbols, with an average MAPE of approximately 3.89% and a median MAPE of about 2.68%. No anomalies were detected, and the guardrails are currently inactive, indicating no system issues. Importantly, there were no risk events during this run, confirming that all business rules functioned as expected. The system is safe to proceed with further evaluations and optimizations.

## Performance Overview
*(Audience: quants)*
- Total symbols processed: 1972
- Models trained: 1972
- Average MAPE: 3.89%
- Median MAPE: 2.68%
- Best performing symbol: ANNX_daily
- Worst performing symbol: TDIC_daily

The model comparison shows that BaselineLinear has dominated the leaderboard with 986 wins against challengers, which did not secure any wins.

## Guardrail and Risk Assessment
*(Audience: ops)*
- Guardrail status: Inactive
- Total checks: 0 (no checks executed)
- Risk events: None detected

With guardrails inactive, there were no system checks performed, and thus no potential issues were identified. The absence of risk events indicates that all business rules were adhered to without triggering any alerts.

## Research Insights
*(Audience: management)*
- Strong directional accuracy observed across several symbols, including AAL_daily and AAPL_daily, both achieving 100% accuracy.
- No anomalies detected, suggesting stable performance across the evaluated models.

## Key Risks
- Inactive guardrails may pose a risk if future runs encounter unexpected data quality issues.
- No HPO trials were conducted, limiting optimization opportunities.

## Key Opportunities
- Consider activating guardrails to ensure system integrity in future runs.
- Explore HPO trials to optimize model performance further.

## Actions for Quants
- Investigate the performance of models, particularly focusing on the worst-performing symbols to identify improvement areas.

## Actions for Ops
- Activate guardrails for the next run to monitor system integrity and data quality.
