# System Forecasting Report
**Generated:** 20251205_020205

## Executive Summary
The latest backtest run processed 1972 symbols with an average MAPE of 3.89%. No anomalies were detected, but guardrails are currently offline, with all checks failing. There were no risk events, indicating that the system is functioning as expected without any business-rule violations. However, the inability to pass guardrails raises concerns about potential configuration issues. Immediate attention is required to address the guardrail failures before proceeding with further operations.
