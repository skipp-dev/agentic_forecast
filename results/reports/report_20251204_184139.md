# System Forecasting Report
**Generated:** 20251204_184139

## Executive Summary
In the latest run of the forecasting platform, a total of 1,972 models were trained, but none were promoted. The average MAPE was approximately 3.89%, with a median of 2.68%. Notably, 573 anomalies were detected, indicating potential issues that require further investigation. The guardrails did not pass any checks, resulting in no warnings or critical issues, but the system is still deemed capable of proceeding. Moving forward, attention should be directed towards addressing the anomalies and optimizing the models that underperformed.

## Performance Overview
*(Audience: quants)*
- A total of 1,972 models were trained, with an average MAPE of 3.89% and a median MAPE of 2.68%.
- The best-performing symbol was ANNX_daily, while TDIC_daily was the worst performer.
- The model comparison leaderboard shows that all evaluated symbols used the BaselineLinear model family.
- Anomalies detected (573) suggest areas for improvement in model accuracy and reliability.

## Guardrail and Risk Assessment
*(Audience: ops)*
- The guardrails executed 555 checks, all of which failed, indicating a need for review of the criteria used.
- There were no warnings or critical issues reported, but the lack of passed checks raises concerns about model readiness.
- The system can proceed, but further analysis is necessary to understand the implications of the failed checks.

## HPO and Optimization Insights
*(Audience: management)*
- The HPO process was completed with 3 optimizations performed on AMZN, AAPL, and MSFT, but no improvements were noted in MAPE.
- Future priorities for optimization should be established based on the performance of these symbols.

## Key Risks
- 573 anomalies detected, indicating potential model reliability issues.
- All guardrail checks failed, raising concerns about model readiness.

## Key Opportunities
- Focus on addressing the detected anomalies to improve model performance.
- Review and refine guardrail checks to ensure better model evaluation.

## Actions for Quants
- Investigate the 573 anomalies to identify root causes and implement corrective measures.
- Review the performance of the worst-performing symbols and consider adjustments to the models.

## Actions for Ops
- Conduct a thorough review of the guardrail checks to understand the reasons for all failures.
- Ensure that the system's ability to proceed is aligned with the risk assessment findings.
