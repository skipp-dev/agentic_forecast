  "global_summary": "The overall performance metrics indicate a concerning lack of predictive accuracy, particularly highlighted by the extremely low mean directional accuracy of 0.013. While MAE and RMSE show reasonable mean values, the high maximum values suggest potential outliers or specific symbols causing significant errors. The variability in metrics is low, indicating a consistent but poor performance across the board. The absence of feature importance in both overall and shock regimes raises concerns about the model's ability to leverage relevant information effectively. Overall, the system appears to be underperforming and may require significant adjustments.",
  "metric_explanations": {
    "mae": "The mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.18 suggests that, on average, predictions are off by this amount. However, the maximum MAE of 58.658 indicates that some predictions are significantly worse, pointing to potential outliers or specific symbols that need investigation.",
    "mape": "The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.039 is relatively low, but the maximum value of 0.446 suggests that certain predictions are highly inaccurate. This discrepancy indicates that while most predictions are reasonably accurate, a few are drastically off.",
    "smape": "The symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE) mirrors MAPE's findings, with a mean of 0.038 and a maximum of 0.358. The low variability suggests that the model's performance is consistently poor across predictions.",
    "mase": "Not available due to lack of baseline comparison metrics in the provided data.",
    "swase": "The mean SWASE of 0.041 indicates low asymmetric error, but the maximum value of 0.479 suggests that there are instances of significant bias in predictions, particularly in certain regimes.",
    "directional_accuracy": "The mean directional accuracy of 0.013 indicates that the model is rarely correct in predicting the direction of changes. This is a critical issue, as it suggests that the model's predictions are not reliable for decision-making."
