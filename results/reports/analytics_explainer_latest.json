  "global_summary": "The stock forecasting system is currently performing within reasonable ranges, with low mean errors across various metrics. However, the directional accuracy is notably low, indicating challenges in predicting the correct direction of stock movements.",
  "metric_explanations": {
    "mae": "Mean Absolute Error (MAE) measures the average magnitude of errors in predictions, without considering their direction. A lower MAE indicates better predictive accuracy.",
    "mape": "Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) expresses prediction errors as a percentage of actual values. It helps gauge the accuracy relative to the size of the actual values, with lower percentages indicating better performance.",
    "smape": "Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE) is similar to MAPE but adjusts for scale, providing a more balanced view of prediction accuracy. It is particularly useful when actual values can be close to zero.",
    "swase": "Symmetric Weighted Absolute Scaled Error (SWASE) is a scaled version of the absolute error that accounts for the variability in the data. It helps to understand how well the model performs relative to the variability of the actual values."
